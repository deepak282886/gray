<h1>Gray</h1>

Gray is the beginning of an ambitious project aimed at leveraging core knowledge to solve novel problems without overfitting. This repository is dedicated to developing intelligent systems that utilize fundamental knowledge domains, starting with color pattern recognition and extending to other areas such as location and size.

Introduction

gray is an advanced AI project designed to create intelligent agents capable of solving novel problems by utilizing core knowledge. The primary focus is on training agents to recognize and interpret color patterns, with future plans to incorporate additional knowledge areas like spatial location and object size. The goal is to ensure these agents solve problems effectively without overfitting.
Features

    Color Pattern Recognition: Train agents to recognize and differentiate various color patterns.
    Location Awareness: Develop agents that understand spatial relationships and locations.
    Size Interpretation: Enable agents to discern and compare object sizes.
    Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable to include more core knowledge domains.
