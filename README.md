<h1>Gray</h1>

Gray is the beginning of an ambitious project aimed at leveraging core knowledge to solve novel problems without overfitting. This repository is dedicated to developing intelligent systems that utilize fundamental knowledge domains, starting with color pattern recognition and extending to other areas such as location and size.

Introduction

gray is an advanced AI project designed to create intelligent agents capable of solving novel problems by utilizing core knowledge.

<h2> Reference Frame and Solver Approach </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This repository showcases an innovative approach to solving problems that large language models (LLMs) inherently struggle with. By leveraging a combination of reference frames and a solver mechanism, we can tackle complex problems across various domains. Initially, this approach has been applied to matrix transformations, but it is designed to be easily scalable to other fields.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<h3></h3>Reference Frames</h3>

Reference frames are hierarchical structures that organize knowledge into categories and subcategories. For the matrix transformation problem, we defined high-level categories such as:

    Size Transformations
    Replication Transformations

These categories are intuitive and help guide the LLM to navigate and select relevant transformations.
Solver Mechanism

The solver applies specific transformations within the selected categories to determine which transformation accurately maps an input matrix to an output matrix. If the transformation is successful, the solver identifies the correct approach.
Example

Given an input matrix and an output matrix, the solver explores transformations such as expanding zeroes or duplicating values. Through this process, it identifies the most relevant transformation that achieves the desired result.

    matrix1 = np.array([
        [0, 7, 7],
        [7, 7, 7],
        [0, 7, 7]
    ])
    matrix2 = np.array([
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7],
        [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7],
        [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7],
        [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
        [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7],
        [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]
    ])
    
    solver = Solver(network)
    categories = ['Size Transformations', 'Replication Transformations'] #predicted by llm
    result = solver.solve(matrix1, matrix2, categories)
    print(result)

<h2>Future Expansion</h2>

This approach has been initially tested on matrix transformations. The flexibility and scalability of using reference frames and a solver mechanism make it suitable for expansion to other complex problem domains. By organizing knowledge into intuitive categories, we can empower LLMs to solve a wide array of problems more effectively.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Our reference frame and solver approach represents a powerful tool for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Through structured knowledge organization and targeted transformations, we can overcome inherent limitations and achieve accurate results in complex scenarios.
